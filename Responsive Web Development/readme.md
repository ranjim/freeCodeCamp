# Responsive Web Development

This folder consists of the HTML/CSS projects that I had made during my Responsive Web Development Course from 
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Contents:

Each folder in this consists of:
1. HTML file - for the webpage
2. CSS file - for stylesheet

*Any extra files referenced would be in the same folder.*

### Disclaimer

The webpages in these folders were made from reference webpages provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). My goal was to replicate the same while fulfilling certain criteria in order to get acquainted with HTML and CSS.
